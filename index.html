                        <h1>Cholera Outbreak</h1>
                        <h3>Soho London 1854</h3>
                        <p>Mid August of 1854, marked the start of an epidemic that would decimate the population in Soho London. The culprit, <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, was thought to be an airborne disease. However, John Snow, a doctor who opened a practice at 54 Firth St. in Soho, believed the source of the outbreak was from contaminated water. His investigation led him to the conclusion that the popular Broad Street water pump was the source of the outbreak.</p>

                            <p>John Snow visualized the data he gathered from his investigation by creating black bars in places where the was a cholera incident. The more incidents there were, the taller the black bars.</p>

                            <p>A modern interpretation of the data done in javascript using plot.ly shows cholera deaths in red and water pumps locations in blue. The deaths caused by cholera is most intense at the broadway water pump and radiates outward. The broadway water pump is the most popular source of water as it was known for its high quality of water so many people frequented this pump. After reviewing his visualization Snow suspected the broadway water pump to be contaminated and the source of the outbreak. Snow alerted officials on September 7, 1854 of his findings.</p>

                            <p>After John Snow presented his findings to Officials on the 7th of September, 1854, the number of total choelra attacks begins to plateau. The number of attacks and deaths caused by cholera slowly declines until September 29, 1854 where there were no longer any more cholera attacks.</p>
                            <p>Data visualizations help to see what normally can't be seen through raw data and statistical analysis. By visualizing his findings on a map John Snow was able to come to the conclusion that the water pump on Broadstreet was the source of the outbreak. As technology advances, data can be visualied in many ways, allowing us to see reimagine data from a different perspective.</p>
